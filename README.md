Simulates a simplified game of bowling.

This is an exercise in learning Ruby and methodically refactoring code. After initially using a naive/one-file approach, the code was refactored into a class-based system.

To do:  
Apply proper scoring for strikes and spares.  
Write test suites.  

To run locally, assuming you have Ruby installed:  
```bash
git clone git@github.com:steviekaye/bowling.git  
cd bowling/  
ruby bowling.rb
```
