### Ruby Bowling

Simulates a simplified game of bowling.

This is an exercise in learning Ruby and methodically refactoring code. After initially using a naive/one-file approach, the code was refactored into a class-based system.

Check out the [before](https://github.com/steviekaye/bowling/blob/6d5d4dcd454b280f391cb4da664504e62094b8de/bowling.rb) and [after](https://github.com/steviekaye/bowling).
